# qickkr social

###### When the qickkr project began, it was supposed to be a polling app but after a while, I decided to make it a bit more complicated (at least from my point of view) so I made qickkr... Sorry if there's any confusion as to why the folders are named "Polls" or something similar.

## What Is qickkr?

###### qickkr is basically a knock off version of any good social media app, it isn't done yet and it lacks many features, but it was something I enjoyed doing as a challenge to myself, and as I write this, I am a bit proud of the experience.

### The plan?
###### As you can guess, there's none, though there are other things that NEED to be included; Logout functionality, Front-end with reactJS, and to find the bug that only allows the first post by the user in the display to be edited or deleted...
